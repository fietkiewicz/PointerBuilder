## Contents

The repository contains the following sections, each with its own additional documentation:

* **App for NEURON:** This application is a NEURON graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **App for Python:** This application is a Python graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **Models:** This collection of NEURON models demonstrates various concepts for neuromechanical simulations using pointers, as detailed in the paper above (Fietkiewicz et al.).
