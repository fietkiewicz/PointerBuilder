# PointerBuilder
PointerBuilder is a tool for working with pointers in NEURON simulations. Details are available in the following paper:

Fietkiewicz, C., Corrales Marco, D., Chiel, H. J. and Thomas, P. J. (2023). Tutorial: Using NEURON for Neuromechanical Simulations. *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience*. [Lotka-Volterra model](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2023.1143323).

All models require [NEURON](https::/neuron.yale.edu) to be installed, and Python versions require [Python](https::/python.org).

Address questions and comments to Dr. Chris Fietkiewicz (fietkiewicz@hws.edu).

## Contents

The repository contains the following sections, each with its own additional documentation:

* **App for NEURON:** This application is a NEURON graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **App for Python:** This application is a Python graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **Models:** This collection of NEURON models demonstrates various concepts for neuromechanical simulations using pointers, as detailed in the paper above (Fietkiewicz et al.).
