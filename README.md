# PointerBuilder
PointerBuilder is a tool for working with pointers in NEURON simulations. Details are available in the following paper:

Fietkiewicz, C., Corrales Marco, D., Chiel, H. J. and Thomas, P. J. (submitted). NEURON Framework for Neuromechanical Simulation. *Frontiers in Neuroscience*.

Questions and comments can be addressed to Dr. Chris Fietkiewicz (fietkiewicz@hws.edu).

## Contents

The repository contains the following sections, each with its own additional documentation:

* **App for NEURON:** This application is a NEURON graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **App for Python:** This application is a Python graphical interface for working with NEURON pointers.

* **Models:** This collection of NEURON models demonstrates various concepts for neuromechanical simulations using pointers, as detailed in the paper above (Fietkiewicz et al.).
