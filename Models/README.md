# PointerBuilder: Models
 PointerBuilder is a tool for working with pointers in NEURON simulations. This directory contains models that demonstrate the use of pointer variables for neuromechanical modeling. Details are available in the following paper:

 Fietkiewicz, C., Corrales Marco, D., Chiel, H. J. and Thomas, P. J. (2023). Tutorial: Using NEURON for Neuromechanical Simulations. *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience*. [Lotka-Volterra model](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2023.1143323).

 All models require [NEURON](https::/neuron.yale.edu) to be installed, and Python versions require [Python](https::/python.org).

Address questions and comments to Dr. Chris Fietkiewicz (fietkiewicz@hws.edu).
